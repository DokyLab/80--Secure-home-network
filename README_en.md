## üìã Key Features

- **Mini PC (NUC)**: Ideal for daily tasks like programming and office work, with prices ranging from **‚Ç¨40 to ‚Ç¨60** for basic options or **‚Ç¨100** for high-performance machines (e.g., Aliexpress).
- **Energy Savings**: Up to **60% energy savings**, making it a cost-effective and sustainable solution in the long run.
- **Gaming PC as a Cloud Server**: Using tools like Moonlight, Sunshine, and [Iddsample Virtual Display Driver](https://github.com/itsmikethetech/Virtual-Display-Driver), you can eliminate the need for a physical monitor during remote gaming sessions.
- **Advanced Firewall (Portmaster)**: Configured to block all unnecessary applications on all devices.
- **High-Performance Network**: A home network bandwidth of at least **1 Gbps** is recommended to ensure system efficiency.
- **Open and Verified Software**: Exclusive use of open-source or verified software.
- **Extended Hardware Lifespan**: By separating lightweight tasks (office work and programming) from gaming, the wear on high-performance PCs is reduced.
- **Learning and Using Linux**: Encourages learning and dedication to open-source operating systems.
- **Support for Open-Source Software**: Promotes the use and development of open-source tools and systems.

## üöÄ Installation and Configuration

### Mini PC (NUC)
1. Purchase a Mini PC (e.g., from Aliexpress for ‚Ç¨40-100).
2. Install a Linux distribution (e.g., Debian or Arch).
3. Configure Portmaster to block all applications except essential ones.

### Gaming PC (Cloud Server)
1. Install a Linux distribution.
2. Set up the following software:
   - [Moonlight](https://moonlight-stream.org/) and [Sunshine](https://github.com/LizardByte/Sunshine).
   - [Iddsample Virtual Display Driver](https://github.com/itsmikethetech/Virtual-Display-Driver) for virtual screen emulation.
3. Configure Portmaster to block all unnecessary applications.

### Network Setup
